1. All of the code are contained in main.ipnyb, except for selecting points for correspondances which I did in Matlab. (I've also included the Matlab instructions in a commented sections)
2. Files ended with mat or json are purely correpondences and points.
3. Folders: female mean faces: only warped towards female average face; male mean faces: are only wared towards male mean faces; and neutral mean faces: both geners.
4. I did two bells and whistles, one "male version of me" and one fun video.
5. I have comments all over the files so it should be clear!
6. I've compressed all the folders hope it won't break anything...
7. I took out the the folder of imm_db of Danes as well since it takes a lot of space.
